# Overview

This is the repository for BallisticPro, which is a modification of Ballistic Weapons, itself a modification for Unreal Tournament 2004 by RuneStorm.

This repository serves as the basis for the Ballistic Community Complete Collection.

This version is based around providing the best possible gameplay and balance for the Ballistic Weapons mod, to fit in with the base styling of Unreal Tournament 2004. Its aim is to give every weapon a role. Many weapons have expanded functionality in this version. The hip fire and sight fire mechanics have also been significantly upgraded compared to the basic game and there are additional mutators and loadout methods provided.
