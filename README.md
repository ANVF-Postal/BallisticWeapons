# Ballistic Weapons mod

This is the public GitHub repository for the Ballistic Weapons mod for Unreal Tournament 2004. While the code is public, the mod's assets are protected.

You can download Ballistic Weapons version 2.5 from [ModDb](https://www.moddb.com/mods/ballistic-weapons/downloads/ballistic-weapons-v25-complete), or the latest version (2.7.1) from [Discord](https://discord.gg/eD4E63e).

Ballistic Weapons adds an arsenal of new firearms, each boasting features from the mod's own custom weapons system. Ballistic weapons feature reloading, firemodes, aiming, a whole new gore system, and even spray patterns. The whole mod is implemented as a highly configurable mutator, making it compatible with a wide variety of other mods and gametypes. Even bots can use Ballistic Weapons.
The mod is divided into four gamestyles: Classic, Tactical, Realistic and Pro, that can make the game feel like a classic arena shooter, or a slower paced competitive shooter.
